# Project Description

[Free Project 7-1] Modify “Stochastic Texts”
When I invited you to modify JavaScript programs, one of them was a classic, Theo Lutz’s “Stochastic Texts” from 1959. I have made this program available, in reimplemented form, not only in JavaScript but also in Python. Find it here and download it:

nickm.com/memslam/stochastic_texts.py
Open the  le in a text editor. copy the code, and paste it into Jupyter Notebook. Then, modify it, as you did when you modi ed a JavaScript program, to make a text generator of your own that is based on this one.
